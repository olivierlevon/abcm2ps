# abcm2ps

A fork of abcm2ps from Jean-Francois Moine (https://github.com/leesavide/abcm2ps and http://moinejf.free.fr/) adding a patch and facilities
in order to ease building on Windows platform :

 - A modified .gitignore for files generated by Visual Studio
 - An appveyor.yml file to allow automated builds and continuous integration
 - A solution, abcm2ps.sln, to build with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 or 2017 Community 
 - A batch file, build_vc14.bat, for command-line build
 - A windows template file (config.h.win32) for config.h 
 - A batch file, config.bat, to copy config.h.win32 in config.h (edits should be done in config.h.win32 !)
 - Integrated files for regex support :
      * regex.h
      *	regex.c
      * regex_internal.h
      * regex_internal.c
      * regcomp.c
      * regexec.c
 - mmap support for windows (mmap-windows.c and mmap-windows.h files)
	  
Some improvements may come later (automated tests, support for standard Windows user folder, Pango support, installer, ...).

### Overview

abcm2ps is a program which converts music tunes from the ABC music
notation to PostScript or SVG.  
Based on the abc2ps version 1.2.5 from Michael Methfessel,
it was first developped to print barock organ scores that have
independant voices played on one or many keyboards and a pedal-board
(the 'm' of abcm2ps stands for many or multi staves/voices).  
Since this time, it has evolved so it can render many more music kinds.

### Features

The main features of abcm2ps are quite the same as the abc2ps ones,
but they are closer to the ABC draft 2.2 (February 2013):

    http://abcnotation.com/wiki/abc:standard:v2.2

### Installation and usage

The installation procedure is described in the file INSTALL.

Basically, the program usage is:

    abcm2ps [options] file1 [file1_options] file2 [file2_options] ...

where file1, file2, .. are the ABC input files. This will generate
a Postscript file (default name: `Out.ps` - run `abcm2ps -h` to
know the list of the command line options).

### Documentation

- options.txt contains the list of the command line options.

- the format parameters are described in:
    http://moinejf.free.fr/abcm2ps-doc/index.html

- the differences from the current ABC standard are described in:
